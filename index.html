    <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>
        When you enter something like http://www.google.com, the request goes to one of many special computers on the Internet known as Domain Name Servers (DNS). All these requests are routed through various routers and switches. The domain name servers keep tables of machine names and their IP addresses, so when you type in http://www.google.com, it gets translated into a number, which identifies the computers that serve the Google Web site to you.</p>
    <p>
        When you want to view any page on the Web, you must initiate the activity by requesting a page using your browser. The browser asks a domain name server to translate the domain name you requested into an IP address. The browser then sends a request to that server for the page you want, using a standard called Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.</p>
    <p>
        The server should constantly be connected to the Internet.ready to serve pages to visitors. When it receives a request, it looks for the requested document and returns it to the Web browser. When a request is made, the server usually logs the client's IP address, the document requested, and the date and time it was requested. This information varies server to server.
    </p>
    <p>
        An average Web page actually requires the Web browser to request more than one file from the Web server and not just the HTML / XHTML page, but also any images, style sheets, and other resources used in the web page. Each of these files including the main page needs a URL to identify each item. Then each item is sent by the Web server to the Web browser and Web browser collects all this information and displays them in the form of Web page.

    <h2>HTML tags</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML tags normally come in pairs like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;</li>
        <li>The first tag in a pair is the <b>start tag</b>, the second tag is the <b>end tag</b></li>
        <li>The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS defines how HTML elements are to be displayed</li>
        <li>Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem</li>
        <li>CSS saves a lot of work</li>
        <li>External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
    <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.</p>
    <p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
    <p>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.</p>
    <p>The image below illustrates the box model:</p>

    <p>Explanation of the different parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Content</b> - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
        <li><b>Padding</b> - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
        <li><b>Border</b> - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
        <li><b>Margin</b> - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
    </ul>
